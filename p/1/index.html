      <h1 class="title">Having fun with coconuts</h1>
      <a href="/p/2"><p>Having fun with coconuts is great. The first thing you need to do to have fun with coconuts is to get a board and put a coconut on top. And then after you put coconut on top and then you get a ball, a small ball like maybe a golf ball, and you just have to simply dry and hit the golf ball. Point No, not golf ball. Um, off the bar. And then? The next way you can try and have fun. Is. 2. Get. Ah. Coconut. So then once you've gotten your coconut, you can put it down, get a Golf Club and try and hit it into a hole. But first you need to get a spade and dig a hole. But. If you want to be more advanced you can do different sized holes and that'll work different points and try and hit the coconut into the different hulks. The next one you could do is you could get a coconut. And then drill three holes in it, spread out like a bowling ball. Then once you've done that, you can, you can get about 10 other coconuts and play bowling with it. Um, that will be fun right? So after you've done that, you can. And we used the coconuts. Ohh. By the way, I should have mentioned you might need, um, quite a lot of palm trees to do all this stuff. So if you don't want palm trees, buy palm trees. So I'd say maybe a packet and even hot place to do all this. But anyway, that's not important right now. Or you could just go to. Up kiland and collect some coconuts and then take them home. Anyway, next thing you could do that's fun with coconuts is you could get a lot and a lot of coconuts. Play Skittles with them. You could get a lot of coconuts and paint them different colours. Uh, play noughts and crosses. And you could also do this, you could get lots of different coconuts, I mean like billions of coconuts literally pretty much. And paint them black and then paint the other ones white. Then you make. The go board in sand and just play go go is good too. So I think you've learned a lot from this so far. But if you want to have fun in this a bit more then I would suggest finding a website. That you like even more than this one somehow? I mean, this is an amazing website, isn't it? Amazing, Amazing, amazing, amazing website. Uh, till next time!</p></a>
