      <h1 class="title">Kids paragraph</h1>
      <p>This paragraph is all about random coconut fun. So first of all, get a coconut and roll it down a hill. Coconut on a hill, mountain, mountain. Let's get started. Coconut I do coconut coconuts. Well, actually, let's stop
learning
about coconuts. Coconuts are boring. What actually, some people anyway, because you can use a COVID. You could put the top, make it into a boat, to make a board, and then you can sail around a water on a coconut beach. Kids, these kids, okay,
now what we're going to do is, we're going to do
is not coconut.
Not how you spell coconuts, how it's spelled. I don't know how to spell coconuts. Anyway, press this to move on to next paragraph.</p>
